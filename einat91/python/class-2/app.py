# 1) List:
# General purpose, most widely used data structure
# Grow and shrink size as needed
# Sequence type
# Sortable
# Not-homogenic data types

# 2) Set:
# Store non-duplicate items
# Very fast access vs Lists
# Math Set ops (union, intersect)
# Unordered

# 3) Tuple:
# Immutable (can't add/ change)
# Useful for fixed data
# Faster than Lists
# Sequence type

# 4) Dict: (dictionaries)
# Key/Value pairs
# Associate array, like Java HashMap
# Unordered

# Sequences (String, List, Tuple)
# Indexing: x[6]
# Slicing: x[1:4]
# Adding/concatenating: +
# Multiplying: *
# Checking membership: in/not in
# Iterating: for i in x:
# len (sequence1)
# min (sequence1)
# max (sequence1)
# sum (sequence1[1:3])
# sorted(list1)
# sequence1.count(item)
# sequence.index(item)
