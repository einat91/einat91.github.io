# Regular Expressions match patterns in the text. They are more dynamic than searching for specific text.
# They are useful for validating user input, to protect the system/website from a hacker attack.
# (SQL Injection/ HTML Injection).
# They also check that the input is of the expected type and can be used in the program.
# Regular expressions can be used for automatic "Find" or "Find/Search" operations in a script which works with text, for example a text-parsing script.
# Modules are Python scripts (.py extensions), they can be run from other script, and/or run others.

# Import Modules
# Module = python script with .py extension
# Package = folder with Python script(s) and an __init__.py file
# Environement = modules and a Python interpreter which runs them. There
# can be several interpreters and several environments on one computer.
# Virtual enviornment = an environment which is contained in a certain folder
# and runs certain versions of packages. They are useful because some versions of some packages are
# versions of packages. They are useful because some versions of some packages are
# incompatible with each other and/or with the Python interpreter, so you can have the
# specific versions of the packages you need in each enviornment and nothing "Breaks".
